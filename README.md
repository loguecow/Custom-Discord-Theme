# LogueX-Discord-Theme

Loguecow discord theme

# Installation

Download the exe file and run it then press install (Install to Stable)
And then when its finished go to settings and then themes and then press open folder and drag the logueX.theme into the folder

You can use any theme you like but i just made my own shitty theme

It uses the HACKED font so you maybe need to install it too
